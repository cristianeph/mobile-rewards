# Prueba TÃ©cnica para Qroma
El app tiene el objetivo de mostrar y canjear articulos o premios en base a puntos sumados segun el cliente.

## Quick Start
Para correr el app:

```
tns run android --bundle
```

> Note: This command will create a new NativeScript app that uses the latest version of this template published to [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tns-template-blank-ng).

## Walkthrough

### Architecture
The application component:
- `app.component.ts` - sets up a page router outlet that lets you navigate between pages.

There is a single blank component that sets up an empty page layout:
- `/home`

**Home** page has the following components:
- `ActionBar` - It holds the title of the page.
- `GridLayout` - The main page layout that should contains all the page content.
